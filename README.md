# Bots for Restaurant Order Management


Welcome to the "Bots for Restaurant Order Management" project! This project is a system of bots designed for social platforms VKontakte (VK) and Telegram (TG) that allow users to easily place orders for restaurant products. The bots also collect necessary information such as name, surname, phone number, and email address, and provide a menu where users can select items and add them to their cart.

## How It Works

1. **Order Placement**: Users interact with the bot and provide the required order information, including their name, surname, phone number, and email address. The bot presents a menu with available items, allowing users to choose and add items to their cart.

2. **Notification to Cooks**: After placing an order, the information is automatically sent to a Telegram group where the cooks are located. Cooks receive notifications about new orders and can mark them as "prepared" to inform the rest of the team that the order is ready for delivery.

3. **Assignment to Delivery Personnel**: Once the order has been confirmed as prepared by the cook, the order information is transferred to a group of delivery personnel. Delivery personnel can view the order details and take responsibility for delivering the order.

4. **Notification to Administrators**: After the order is successfully delivered by the assigned personnel, information about the completed order is sent to a group of administrators. Administrators can monitor the entire process and take appropriate actions as needed.

5. **Customer Feedback**: Customers whose orders have been delivered receive a notification inviting them to leave feedback about the received items and the quality of service.

## Project Features

- **Database Integration**: The entire project operates with a database that stores all the necessary data about customers, orders, and feedback. This ensures data integrity even in the event of server failures and allows for the recovery of the system without any loss of data.

- **Extensibility**: The project is designed with extensibility in mind. You can easily add new items to the restaurant's menu or modify the order processing logic to suit the specific requirements of your restaurant.

- **User-Friendly Experience**: The VK and Telegram bots are developed with a focus on providing a user-friendly experience. The user interface is intuitive, enabling users to place orders and interact with the system seamlessly.

We hope that our "Bots for Restaurant Order Management" project will serve as a reliable tool for your restaurant, saving time and simplifying the order processing workflow. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to us. Enjoy using the system!
